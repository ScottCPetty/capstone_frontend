# Overview
This frontend was created was created by Patrick Williams, James Pope, and Scott Petty in two weeks for our Fullstack Academy capstone project. 
It is a single-page application made in React that allows users to:
- play a game we wrote in HTML and JavaScript,
- register and login,
- edit their information, and
- save their scores, which appear on a public leaderboard.

It was made in tandem with [this backend](https://github.com/ScottCPetty/capstone_backend).
